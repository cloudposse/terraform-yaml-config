Terraform module to convert local and remote YAML configuration templates into Terraform lists and maps.


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>

## Introduction

The module accepts paths to local and remote YAML configuration template files
and converts the templates into Terraform lists and maps for consumption in other Terraform modules.

The module can accept a map of parameters for interpolation within the YAML config templates.

The module also supports a top-level `import` attribute in map configuration templates, which will include the file and perform a deep merge.
Up to 10 levels of imports hierarchy are supported, and all imported maps are deep merged into a final configuration map.

For example, if you have a config file like this (e.g. `myconfig.yaml`):

  ```yaml
    import:
      - file1
      - file2
  ```

Then, this module will deep merge `file1.yaml` and `file2.yaml` into `myconfig.yaml`.

__Note:__ Do not include the extensions (e.g. `.yaml`) in the imports.

Big thanks to [Imperative Systems Inc.](https://github.com/Imperative-Systems-Inc)
for the excellent [deepmerge](https://github.com/Imperative-Systems-Inc/terraform-modules/tree/master/deepmerge) Terraform module
to perform a deep map merge of standard Terraform maps and objects.




## Usage

For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
(which tests and deploys the example on Datadog), see [test](test).

For an example of using local config maps with `import` and deep merging into a final configuration map, see [examples/imports-local](examples/imports-local).

For an example of using remote config maps with `import` and deep merging into a final configuration map, see [examples/imports-remote](examples/imports-remote).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.





## Examples


### Example of local and remote maps and lists configurations with interpolation parameters

```hcl
module "yaml_config" {
  source = "cloudposse/config/yaml"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"

  map_config_local_base_path = "./config"

  map_config_paths = [
    "map-configs/*.yaml",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/master/examples/config/resources/services.yaml",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/master/examples/config/resources/team_routing_rules.yaml"
  ]

  list_config_local_base_path = "./config"

  list_config_paths = [
    "list-configs/*.yaml",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-service-control-policies/master/examples/complete/policies/organization-policies.yaml"
  ]

  parameters = {
    param1 = "1"
    param2 = "2"
  }

  context = module.this.context
}
```

### Example of local maps configurations with `import` and deep merging

In the example, we use two levels of imports,
and the module deep merges the local config files `imports-level-3.yaml`, `imports-level-2.yaml`, and `imports-level-1.yaml`
into a final config map.

See [examples/imports-local](examples/imports-local) for more details.

```hcl
module "yaml_config" {
  source = "cloudposse/config/yaml"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"

  map_config_local_base_path = "./config"

  map_config_paths = [
    "imports-level-1.yaml"
  ]

  context = module.this.context
}
```

### Example of remote maps configurations with with `import` and deep merging

In the example, we use two levels of imports,
and the module deep merges the remote config files `globals.yaml`, `ue2-globals.yaml`, and `ue2-prod.yaml`
into a final config map.

See [examples/imports-remote](examples/imports-remote) for more details.

```hcl
module "yaml_config" {
  source = "cloudposse/config/yaml"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"

  map_config_remote_base_path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/atmos/master/example/stacks"

  map_config_paths = [
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/atmos/master/example/stacks/ue2-prod.yaml"
  ]

  context = module.this.context
}
```
