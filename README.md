It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out!






## Introduction

The module accepts paths to local and remote YAML configuration template files
and converts the templates into Terraform lists and maps for consumption in other Terraform modules.

The module can accept a map of parameters for interpolation within the YAML config templates.

The module also supports a top-level `import` attribute in map configuration templates, which will include the file and perform a deep merge.
Up to 10 levels of imports hierarchy are supported, and all imported maps are deep merged into a final configuration map.

For example, if you have a config file like this (e.g. `myconfig.yaml`):

  ```yaml
    import:
      - file1
      - file2
  ```

Then, this module will deep merge `file1.yaml` and `file2.yaml` into `myconfig.yaml`.

__Note:__ Do not include the extensions (e.g. `.yaml`) in the imports.

### Attributions

Big thanks to [Imperative Systems Inc.](https://github.com/Imperative-Systems-Inc)
for the excellent [deepmerge](https://github.com/Imperative-Systems-Inc/terraform-modules/tree/master/deepmerge) Terraform module
to perform a deep map merge of standard Terraform maps and objects.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
(which tests and deploys the example on Datadog), see [test](test).

For an example of using local config maps with `import` and deep merging into a final configuration map, see [examples/imports-local](examples/imports-local).

For an example of using remote config maps with `import` and deep merging into a final configuration map, see [examples/imports-remote](examples/imports-remote).




## Examples


### Example of local and remote maps and lists configurations with interpolation parameters

```hcl
module "yaml_config" {
  source = "cloudposse/config/yaml"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"

  map_config_local_base_path = "./config"

  map_config_paths = [
    "map-configs/*.yaml",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/master/examples/config/resources/services.yaml",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/terraform-opsgenie-incident-management/master/examples/config/resources/team_routing_rules.yaml"
  ]

  list_config_local_base_path = "./config"

  list_config_paths = [
    "list-configs/*.yaml",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-service-control-policies/master/examples/complete/policies/organization-policies.yaml"
  ]

  parameters = {
    param1 = "1"
    param2 = "2"
  }

  context = module.this.context
}
```

### Example of local maps configurations with `import` and deep merging

In the example, we use two levels of imports,
and the module deep merges the local config files `imports-level-3.yaml`, `imports-level-2.yaml`, and `imports-level-1.yaml`
into a final config map.

See [examples/imports-local](examples/imports-local) for more details.

```hcl
module "yaml_config" {
  source = "cloudposse/config/yaml"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"

  map_config_local_base_path = "./config"

  map_config_paths = [
    "imports-level-1.yaml"
  ]

  context = module.this.context
}
```

### Example of remote maps configurations with with `import` and deep merging

In the example, we use two levels of imports,
and the module deep merges the remote config files `globals.yaml`, `ue2-globals.yaml`, and `ue2-prod.yaml`
into a final config map.

See [examples/imports-remote](examples/imports-remote) for more details.

```hcl
module "yaml_config" {
  source = "cloudposse/config/yaml"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"

  map_config_remote_base_path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/atmos/master/example/stacks"

  map_config_paths = [
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudposse/atmos/master/example/stacks/ue2-prod.yaml"
  ]

  context = module.this.context
}
```
