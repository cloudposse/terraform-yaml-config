# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to convert YAML configurations into Terraform lists and maps.

# Introduction to the project
introduction: |-
  The module accepts paths to local or remote YAML configuration files and converts the YAML configs into Terraform lists and maps for consumption in other Terraform modules.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
  (which tests and deploys the example on Datadog), see [test](test).
